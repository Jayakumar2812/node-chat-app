# Node-Chat-App
This is a chat application written in Node js.
<br>
The basic styling is done using HTML5,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
<br>
The chat application uses websocket and Express js  for the server side.
<br>
This is similar to a club house where the concept of rooms come into play.
<br>
Anyone can join any room if they know the password for that particular room.
<br>
They can share their live locations as well.
<br>
Cursing is prohibited in the chat room and hence you won't be abe to curse in english at the very least.
